 * Runtime detection of which JS world this bundle landed in.
 *
 * `injected.js` is declared in manifest.json as a `world: "MAIN"` content script
 * so it runs in the page context synchronously at document_start, before any SC
 * script. Browsers that predate that manifest key (Chrome/Edge < 111,
 * Firefox < 128) ignore it and run the file as a regular isolated-world content
 * script instead, where patching `fetch` has no effect on the page.
 *
 * Isolated worlds always expose the extension API with a runtime id. The page
 * world never does: Chrome exposes a bare `chrome` object (and, for
 * externally-connectable pages, a `chrome.runtime` without `id`), Firefox
 * exposes nothing.
